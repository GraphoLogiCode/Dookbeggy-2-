<h2>CS Farming</h2>
<p>Farming is the act of killing waves of Minion icon minions and Monster icon monsters to gather Gold gold and Experience icon experience. Farming is an essential component of early-game laning, when players try to overpower the enemy through an arms-race. Early game is the safest time players can farm to buy items and learn abilities that increase their power.</p>
